AccountsClientPHP
=================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ozzyfant/AccountsClientPHP.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ozzyfant/AccountsClientPHP)

This is a PHP implementation of Mojang's [AccountsClient](https://github.com/Mojang/AccountsClient) for Minecraft. It uses Mojangs public API to convert **player names -> UUID** and **UUIDs -> player names**.

A big thanks to the guys at the [AccountsClient wiki](https://github.com/Mojang/AccountsClient/wiki), who created this wonderful documentation. I would have had a hard time without their documentation.

## Example
Examples can be found in [example.php](https://github.com/ozzyfant/AccountsClientPHP/blob/master/example.php).
